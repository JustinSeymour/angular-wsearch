## Notes

- Angular escapes HTML to remove security concerns.
- You should only ever display html that you have written


- This saves us from cross site scripting attacks. Or XSS attacks.
- Attackers embeds javascript in html elements.


## RXjs

- Functional reactive programming language

- Seperate library from Angular
- Used extensively by Angular for managing data
- We this instead of promises or async/await for handling async stuff
- Not strictly required, we can use promises and async/await.
- Rxjs makes building some kinds of features really really easy compared to writing normal code.
- Hard. Probably the hardest thing the world of JS. period.
- If you can get a good grasp of RXJS, all of angular is at your fingertips!
